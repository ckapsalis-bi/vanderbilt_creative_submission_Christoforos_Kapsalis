ABOUT NPS PHARMACY 
NPS Pharmacy (NPS) is on a mission to provide the most culturally competent pharmacy services to patients living with HIV, members of the LGBTQ+ community, communities of color, and patients of low socioeconomic status. Today, nearly 20,000 patients from Ryan White/STD Grantees, AIDS Services Organizations, and Federally Qualified Health Centers nationwide get their pharmacy services from NPS Pharmacy.
Unlike other pharmacy companies, NPS creates a nationwide network of pharmacies where every team member’s #1 priority is the patient. NPS expects every team member to always go above and beyond our industry’s standard to care for every patient—no matter who they are or where they come from. We believe this is accomplished by delivering superior clinical pharmacy service to every patient who walks through our doors.
Unlike our competitors, NPS never puts profit above patients, as our company does not have to answer private investors or venture capital firms. We see ourselves as having a bigger purpose than filling prescriptions and delivering pharmacy services. We believe it is our duty to serve our neighbors, friends, colleagues, and acquaintances as unselfishly as possible and to the highest level of service we can deliver.
DIVERSITY, EQUITY, INCLUSION, &amp; ACCESS 
NPS is unapologetically accepting and affirming diversity, equity, inclusion, and lived experiences as values shaping our future. We believe in actively fostering a culture that respects, celebrates, and values differences, serving as a catalyst to accomplishing our mission of providing culturally competent healthcare in a safe and affirming environment where all individuals feel welcome, valued, and have equal access to care and services.
CORE BELIEFS
1. Make decisions locally, quickly, and always in the best interest of patients.
2. Do everything with the highest levels of integrity.
3. Always be 100% honest and transparent.
PHILANTHROPIC GIVING &amp; SOCIAL IMPACT 
NPS believes in giving back to the communities that have given so much to our company and our patients over the last 23 years. Annually, NPS donates a significant share of its net income to support organizations focused on individuals living with HIV, individuals at risk of contracting HIV or STD/STIs, LGBTQ+ causes, individuals and households of lower socioeconomic status, or individuals from marginalized communities that experience discrimination and stigma.

Do you look busy all the time? Would you like to put that energy to good use in a team working in a fast-paced environment and interacting with our valued customers, partners, and teammates? Execute established processes, and once mastered, take new Luggers under your wing, teaching and leading them to be successful.
 
 
 
  The Junkluggers is a caring alternative to traditional furniture and junk removal with a commitment to enhance lives, the community &amp; the environment by donating &amp; recycling unwanted items from residents and businesses and by supporting local charities.

 You think being part of a fun team is cool?
 
  Yeah, we do too. What we do is hard work, so you need to be motivated and give it your all. But, what we do is also FUN. We have a unique team environment where we all get along and want to help one another (team celebrations and lunches are always great!).
 
 WHO IS A SUCCESSFUL CANDIDATE?
 
  You must be friendly, highly motivated, and able to communicate effectively with our valued customers, partners, and teammates.

You must also be physically fit and able to lift substantial weight. Added bonus if you have experience driving a small truck and moving furniture / heavy items.
 
 
 
  You are someone who cares about others and the environment and gets excited about getting customers' items to those who can benefit from them and keeping customersâ€™ items out of the landfill. You have the ability to recognize the value of items and will treat them with care.
 
 
 
  You are looking to work hard, own your paycheck, and gain hands-on business experience. You are excited to join a team that strives to AMAZE every customer with exceptional customer service. You are committed to reaching your full potential in a supportive learning environment.

Vacation Leave will be accrued if employee is out on a type of paid time off.
