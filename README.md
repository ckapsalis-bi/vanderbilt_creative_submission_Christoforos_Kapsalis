# Overview
Being a Greek citizen that has never visited the US before, I have little sense of the job market situation in Nashville, TN. Thus, I employed my knowledge in data analysis and research to uncover some important insights. These insights were used in crafting the theme of my suggestion in promoting the benefits of working in Nashville to young people.

# Steps Taken 
### 1. Initial query to indeed.com:
Since we are only talking about young professionals, I looked for "Full-Time" and "Entry Level" job postings in the location of "Nashville, TN (within 35 miles)".

### 2. Used the free-trial of an esteemed tool to scrape a few hundreds of the most relevant results
The tool used was "Indeed Job Scraper" on apify.com

The previous I did to understand the types of jobs that are needed the most in the city. I also did it to inform myself on the most active and thriving industries in Nashville. Going through job descriptions also helped me get an idea on the stance of employers against applicants based on the language used, together with the required soft and hard skills mentioned.

For this analysis I used python and a local PostgreSQL database I set up, so that it is fully reproducible with free-to-use tools.
